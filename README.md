### Challenger done in classroom for a basic hotel registration and booking system.
- Basic hotel system with **Registration**, **Reservations** and **Calculation of stay** according to the room chosen by the customer.
> Added Rules for greater logical challenge:
use only variables, conditionals ***(if, elif, else)*** and lists.
The system must not contain loops ***(for, while)*** or ***(functions)*** and the system must consider all possible customer choices.
